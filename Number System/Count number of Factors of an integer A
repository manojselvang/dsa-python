Question:
Given an integer A, you need to find the count of it's factors.
Factor if a number is the number which divides it perfectly leaving no remainder.

Example: 1,2,3,6 are factors of 6

Code:

def count_factors(A):
  count = 0

  N = int(A**0.5 + 1)      # A^(1/2) = root of A - reason to reduce the number of iterations to make the code more time effecient

  for i in range(1,N):
    if A%i == 0:           # if i is a divisor of A - continue
      if i != A/i:         # if i the divisor is not equal to A/i (handle edge cases like i and A/i are equal) e.g., 2*2, 3*3, 4*4...
        count += 2         # Then increment count by 2
      else:
        count = 1          # if not, increment count by 1
  return count             # return count 1
